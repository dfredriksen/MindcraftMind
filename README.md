# MindcraftMind

Intended to be an interface between the Minecraft Desktop Java Edition client (1.15.2) for Windows 10 and a reinforcement learning agent. 

The official RL agent for Minecraft is (Project Malmö)[https://github.com/microsoft/malmo]. At the time of development, Malmö did not support Minecraft clients greater than 1.11, and I wanted to use the bot on my own Minecraft server (which is purely vanilla). As a result, MindcraftMind and the gym_MinecraftLive project were born. 

It's my intent to use this as a stepping stone for other RL projects where there is not an easy access plugin or API to the target environment.

## Installation

You will need a paid Minecraft account to use MindcraftMind to control an Avatar with vanilla Minecraft
